/**
 * Derived design-status helpers for list-view chips.
 *
 * The Firestore `designs` doc stores its progression inside the
 * JSON-encoded `content` blob (`content.approvedPhases`). List APIs
 * return the raw doc - i.e. `content` as a stringified JSON - so the
 * dashboard / Designs list had no easy way to tell whether a design
 * was finalised. Before this, both surfaces fell back to a "touched
 * in last 14 days" heuristic which mislabelled every saved-and-shipped
 * design as "In progress" (reported as issue #31).
 *
 * `getDesignProgress` is a pure function over the raw design row. It
 * returns the approvedPhases list, a derived completion flag, and a
 * short human-readable "stage" label that the list slabs render as a
 * chip ("Stage: Hypotheses").
