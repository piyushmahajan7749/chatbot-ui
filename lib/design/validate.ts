/**
 * Validation agent — the engine behind the Validate-and-iterate stage.
 *
 * A scientist runs the current design in the lab, brings back data, and this
 * agent judges the hypothesis against that data. Crucially it's given the FULL
 * history of prior iterations plus a running `cumulativeInsights` synthesis, so
 * round N reasons over everything learned in rounds 1..N-1 and gets more
 * focused each time (job story: "at iteration 17 it knows every pattern so
 * far"). It returns a verdict, fresh insights, a REFRESHED cumulative synthesis
 * to carry forward, concrete next changes, and — when the data refutes the
 * hypothesis — a sharper hypothesis to test next.
 *
 * Pure-ish: inputs in, structured result + the raw completion out (so the
 * caller meters token usage). No persistence here.

- caveats — data-quality flags a reviewer needs: missing controls, low/absent replication (n), high variance, unclear units, or "no numeric data found". [] if none.
